        <h1>Hello! I'm Bryan, recently a Senior Software Engineer @ GOAT.</h1>
        
        <p>
            I'm a senior backend engineer with 10 years of experience building distributed, high-scale systems. I love working on challenging problems, and I'm always eager to learn new things and push the boundaries of what's possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I believe in building things that matter, especially where I can see the direct impact of what I'm bulding. I'm drawn to projects that require creative thinking, technical depth, and a keen eye for detail. I enjoy the process of understanding complex systems and finding elegant solutions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Outside of work, I like to try new coffee shops, travel, and play whatever video game has me addicted to it. (Currently VALORANT in case you're wondering 😅) You can also find me streaming on Twitch from time to time. 
            Of course these hobbies are currently on pause since we just welcomed our first child and have been learning how to be a dad. 👶🏽
